--------------------------------
1. There is no package.json or package-lock.json file to install npm dependencies for this project.
2. trying to run node index.html throws an error of Cannot find module '/hiring/run'
3. I'm guessing the npm dependencies were .gitignored and can be easily fixed by excluding package.json and package-lock.json from the .gitignore file.
